#  OSP Release Notes - 2020B

## Transducers

Stable and no issues reported. https://github.com/nihospr01/OpenSpeechPlatform-UCSD/tree/2020a

## Hardware

No changes from 2020a. https://github.com/nihospr01/OpenSpeechPlatform-UCSD/tree/2020a 

## Firmware and OS

2020a includes baseline version of libIMU that provides access to raw data from the three IMUs (3-D Accl and 3D-gyro data from left ear, right ear, and processing unit – a total of 18 dimensional vector at 100 Hz sampling) corresponding to physical activity and head motion.


## Software


Libosp now has the ability to switch between 6 and 10 bands.  There is a new command-line interface to directly control it.


A binary software installer is available for the Mac, and soon for Linux.  



## Applications


In 2020a, we introduced Node.js and React for extending EWS features. Both are based on JavaScript and expected to improve rapid prototyping capabilities of OSP for audiology research.   For 2020b we have reimplemented most of the old PHP/Laravel apps in Node/React.
