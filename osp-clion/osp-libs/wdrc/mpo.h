/**
 * @brief Function to apply dynamic-range compression to a single sub-band of the output of the analysis filter bank.
 *
 * The peak detector output in dB SPL is needed as one of the inputs. The gain at 50 and 80 dB SPL is specified 
 * for the frequency sub-band, along with the lower and upper kneepoints in dB SPL. 
 * The compressor is linear below the lower kneepoint and applies compression limiting above the upper kneepoint
 *
 * @param input Pointer to the signal array at the frequency sub-band (output from sub-band filtering)
 * @param pdB Pointer to the peak detector output array of the sub-band in dB SPL (output from peak_to_spl)
 * @param wdrcdB Gain in dB at the sub-band frequency for an input at 50 dB SPL
 * @param mpo_limit Upper kneepoint in dB SPL for the sub-band
 * @param len Length of the input array
 * @param out Pointer to an array where the compressed output of the sub-band will be written. i.e. the output of MPO limiter
