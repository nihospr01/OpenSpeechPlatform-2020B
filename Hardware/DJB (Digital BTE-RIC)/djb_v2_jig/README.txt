 Digital Jellybean V2 Programming Jig
 
 Note that the design was mistakenly created upside-down! However, simply solder it together upside down--with the pogo pins sticking out of the bottom of board A, through board B below board A--and it will work just fine. (We have assembled one of them with this process and used it to program all our DJBs.)
