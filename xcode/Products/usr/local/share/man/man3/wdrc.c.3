.PP
Function to apply dynamic-range compression to a single sub-band of the output of the analysis filter bank\&. The peak detector output in dB SPL is needed as one of the inputs\&. The gain at 50 and 80 dB SPL is specified for the frequency sub-band, along with the lower and upper kneepoints in dB SPL\&. The compressor is linear below the lower kneepoint and applies compression limiting above the upper kneepoint
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIinput\fP Pointer to the signal array at the frequency sub-band (output from sub-band filtering) 
.br
\fIpdB\fP Pointer to the peak detector output array of the sub-band in dB SPL (output from peak_to_spl) 
.br
\fIgain50\fP Gain in dB at the sub-band frequency for an input at 50 dB SPL 
.br
\fIgain80\fP Gain in dB at the sub-band frequency for an input at 80 dB SPL 
.br
\fIknee_low\fP Lower kneepoint in dB SPL for the sub-band 
.br
\fIknee_high\fP Upper kneepoint in dB SPL for the sub-band 
.br
\fIlen\fP Length of the input array 
.br
\fIout\fP Pointer to an array where the compressed output of the sub-band will be written\&. i\&.e\&. the output of WDRC
