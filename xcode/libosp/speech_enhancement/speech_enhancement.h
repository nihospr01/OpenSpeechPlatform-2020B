/*
 * @brief Function to compute the spectral subtraction gains as a function of
 *  frequency band and apply them to the noisy speech. The noise power is
 *  estimated from the noisy speech using minina statistics. Two versions of
 *  spectral subtraction are implemented: Power spectral subtraction with a
 *  fixed oversubtraction factor.
 *	@param input Pointer to the signal array at the frequency sub-band
 *  @param ntype Noise estimation procedure: 1 = Arslan et al. (ICASSP '95) averaging procedure, 2 = Hirsch & Ehrlicher (ICASSP '95) wgt ave procedure, 3 = Cohen & Berdugo MCRA (IEEE Sig Proc Let 9, pp 12-15, 2002)
 *  @param stype Spectral subtraction algorithm: 0 = skip, 1 = oversubtraction (Wiener filter if factor = 1)
 *  @param sparam Spectral subtraction parameters, If stype = 1: param = oversubtraction factor
 *  @param fsamp sampling rate in Hz
 *  @param out Pointer to an array where the enhanced speech data is written to.
